## The Old Way

If you have ever exposed a service from home, you know the classic approach: open a port, point DNS at your public IP, hope your firewall is tight.

Cloudflare Tunnel flips that entire model.

## How It Works

Instead of allowing inbound connections, you run `cloudflared` inside your network making outbound-only connections to Cloudflare's edge.

This gives you two big wins:

- **No inbound ports** on your router
- **Your origin stays hidden** behind Cloudflare's WAF/DDoS protection

## Why This Beats Port Forwarding

- **No inbound ports** — firewall stays closed
- **Hidden origin IP** — your public IP is not revealed
- **WAF and DDoS protection** — Cloudflare absorbs attacks
- **CGNAT friendly** — works without a real public IP

## Quickstart

Install `cloudflared`, authenticate, create a tunnel, configure ingress rules mapping hostnames to local services, route DNS, and run.

## NixOS Integration

On NixOS, manage the connector as a systemd service — fully declarative, just like everything else in your config.
