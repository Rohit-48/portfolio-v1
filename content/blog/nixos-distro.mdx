## NixOS: A Purely Functional Linux Distribution

Hey, glad you found this blog — it is a good one. Let me start with a quick story about how I discovered this absolute banger of a distro.

Back in college, we had a Linux course. Around that time, one of my classmates told me to dual boot Linux. At first, I had no clue what "dual boot" even meant.

## The Arch Detour

I already knew Linux had a ton of distributions, and eventually I landed on **Arch Linux**. Yes, I tried to install Arch on my first attempt at dual booting.

After failing three times, I finally managed to install Arch Linux with KDE Plasma on my fourth try. It worked, but my system kept freezing.

## Discovering NixOS

During that desperate web search phase, I stumbled upon **NixOS**.

I dual booted it, started using it, and instantly fell in love: an immutable, declarative distro where everything is configured in one file. You can roll back, rebuild, and do anything you want.

## The Academic Foundation

NixOS is based on the PhD thesis of Eelco Dolstra: **The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model**.

- **Eelco's thesis** = Nix
- **Nix** = NixOS
- **NixOS** = declarative Linux on steroids

## Why NixOS Wins

- **Reproducibility** — same config, same system, every time
- **Atomic rollbacks** — if something breaks, roll back in one command
- **Declarative** — entire system described in one file
- **No dependency hell** — Nix isolates packages so they never conflict
